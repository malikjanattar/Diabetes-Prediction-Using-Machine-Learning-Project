# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on certain medical attributes. The dataset used for this project includes information such as blood pressure, BMI, age, and glucose levels. The machine learning model will be trained on this data to make predictions on new patients



## Problem Definition
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
## Data
The data used in this project is taken from kaggel. It contains information on 766 patients, including 8 attributes.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
## Step taken to build the model.
- Taking the data and creating the data frame
- EDA
- Data Visualization
- Dividing data into input(x) and output(y)
- Creating the train and test varibles
- Creating the model 
- Fit the model
- Predicting the output
- Evaluation
## Model
In our project we have used logistic regression model,randomforest classifier model & Knn model 

Logistic regression model give the highest accuracy hence we logistic model will be trained and tested on the given data to make predictions on new patients
## Results
The model will make predictions on new patients and output the accuracy of the predictions. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated based on the confusion matrix and other metrics.
